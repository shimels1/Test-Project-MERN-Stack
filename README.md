# Test-Project-MERN-Stack

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The frontend displays a list of songs and allows clients to create, update, and delete songs. Additionally, it includes a section to display statistics data. The frontend communicates with the backend REST API to perform these functionalities.

## Features

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used to store song data.
- **Express**: Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server side.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, update, and delete songs through the frontend.
- **Statistics Section**: Displays statistics related to the songs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running the backend and frontend)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for the database)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for managing project dependencies)

## Installation

### Backend (Node.js & Express)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shimels1/Test-Project-MERN-Stack.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The backend will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- The frontend (React) interacts with the backend (Express) to perform basic CRUD operations on the list of songs.
- The statistics section displays relevant data related to the songs.
- You can test the application locally by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` for the UI, which communicates with the backend server running at `http://localhost:5000`.
